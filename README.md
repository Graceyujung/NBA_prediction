# nba_prediction
In this project, we read the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3635638.3635646) which predicts game winners and losers of the NBA, and reproduce methods introduced by the paper. After that, we try other machine learning algorithms and update model parameters to improve accuracy

## Dataset
We used this [NBA dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games?resource=download) for training.
